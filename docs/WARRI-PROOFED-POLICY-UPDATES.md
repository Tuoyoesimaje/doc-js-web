# WARRI-PROOFED POLICY UPDATES FOR DOC JS LAUNDRY

## Critical Updates to Implement

### 1. UPDATED LIABILITY CAP (Section 2.1)
**Change from:** ₦10,000 cap
**Change to:** ₦15,000 cap (adjusted for 2026 market value)

**New Text:**
"Our liability for any lost or damaged item shall not exceed 10 times the cleaning charge for that item. This is capped at a maximum of ₦15,000 per item (adjusted for 2026 market value) for non-declared goods, regardless of brand or sentimental value."

**Examples:**
- Cleaning cost: ₦900 → Maximum liability: ₦9,000
- Cleaning cost: ₦1,300 → Maximum liability: ₦13,000
- Cleaning cost: ₦2,000 → Maximum liability: ₦15,000 (capped)
- Cleaning cost: ₦3,000 → Maximum liability: ₦15,000 (capped)

### 2. NEW SECTION: STARCH CLAUSE (Section 4.3)
**Add this new section after "Normal Cleaning Outcomes":**

**4.3 Starch Preferences**

"Starch levels are subjective. Unless a specific starch level (light, medium, heavy) is clearly noted on the collection slip at the time of drop-off, our professional judgment is final. Re-washes due to starch preference will be charged at 50% of the original cleaning cost.

We are not liable for damage to fabrics that should not be starched if you insist on starching against our professional advice."

---

### 3. LAUNDRY TAG SECURITY (Section 5.1)
**Add to Reporting Deadlines section:**

**CRITICAL ADDITION:**
"**LAUNDRY TAG REQUIREMENT:** No claim for damage or loss will be entertained if the plastic ID tag or barcode has been removed from the garment. The original laundry tag MUST remain attached to the item for a claim to be valid."

**Also add:**
"For in-store pickups, we strongly advise customers to inspect items before leaving the premises. Once an item leaves the shop or 24 hours pass after home delivery, Doc JS Laundry is legally released from all liability."

---

### 4. COLOR BLEEDING - LOCAL FABRICS (Section 4.2)
**Add to Normal Cleaning Outcomes:**

"We are not liable for:
- Color bleeding between garments during washing
- **Color bleeding on local fabrics (Ankara, Adire, lace, etc.) or multi-colored garments where one color bleeds into another, as this is a defect in the fabric's dye-fastness, not our process**
- Shrinkage up to 5% (natural fabric behavior)
- Color fading from normal detergent use
- Texture changes in certain fabrics after washing
- Pilling on wool, cotton blends, or synthetic materials"

---

### 5. UNCLAIMED ITEMS - FASTER TIMELINE (Section 6.3)
**Change from:** 90 days abandoned, 30 days storage fees
**Change to:** 45 days abandoned, 14 days storage fees

**New Text:**

**In-Store:**
- Items not collected within **45 days** of ready date will be considered abandoned
- After **90 days**, we may dispose of items or donate to charity
- No refunds for unclaimed items

**Online Orders:**
- If you fail to schedule delivery within 14 days of completion, storage fees of **₦500 per day** apply
- Items not collected within **45 days** are considered abandoned
- After **90 days** total, items may be disposed of or donated

**Storage Fee Notice:** "To encourage timely collection and manage our limited space, storage fees begin from Day 14 after your collection date. Please collect your items promptly to avoid additional charges."

## WHY THESE CHANGES MATTER FOR WARRI MARKET

### 1. **Starch Clause**
- Warri customers are VERY particular about starch levels
- Prevents disputes over "too much" or "too little" starch
- Charges for re-wash discourages frivolous complaints

### 2. **Laundry Tag Security**
- Prevents fraud: customers wearing items, staining them, then claiming you did it
- Tag removal = no claim accepted
- Common scam in Nigerian laundry businesses

### 3. **₦15,000 Cap (vs ₦10,000)**
- High-quality Senator materials now cost ₦25,000-₦40,000
- ₦10,000 feels too low for premium service
- ₦15,000 is more reasonable while still protecting you
- STILL enforce High-Value Declaration for expensive items

### 4. **Local Fabric Clause**
- Ankara, Adire, and local lace often have poor dye quality
- Colors bleed naturally - not your fault
- Protects you from claims on fabric defects

### 5. **Faster Unclaimed Timeline**
- 45 days (vs 90) for abandoned status
- Storage fees from Day 14 (vs Day 30)
- Encourages faster pickup
- Manages limited space better
- Still gives 90 days before disposal
